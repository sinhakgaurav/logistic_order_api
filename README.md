## How to Install & Run

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Set Google Distance API key in environment file located in ./code .env file
3.  Run `./start.sh` to build docker containers, executing migration and PHPunit test cases

	- Table migrations using artisan migrate command.
	- Dummy Data imports using artisan db:seed command.

## Manually Migrating tables and Data Seeding

1. To run migrations manually use this command `docker exec order_app_php php artisan migrate`
2. To run data import manually use this command `docker exec order_app_php php artisan db:seed`

## Manually Starting the docker and test Cases

1. You can run `docker-compose up` from terminal
2. Server is accessible at `http://localhost:8080`
3. Run manual testcase suite:
	- Integration Tests: `docker exec order_app_php php ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit /var/www/html/tests/Feature/OrderIntegrationTest.php` &
	- Unit Tests: `docker exec order_app_php php ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit /var/www/html/tests/Unit/OrderUnitTest.php`

## How to Run Tests (Explicity from cli)

 Test Cases can be executed by:
- Integration Tests: `docker exec order_app_php php ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit /var/www/html/tests/Feature/OrderIntegrationTest.php` &
- Unit Tests: `docker exec order_app_php php ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit /var/www/html/tests/Unit/OrderUnitTest.php`
